# Object Oriented Programming using Ruby
This repository houses my solutions to the challenges found [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop).

### Project 1: Tic Tac Toe - __Status:__ Implementing
The game we all played when we were supposed to be learning to carry the 3, now you can play it instead of reading your boss' emails!

### Project 2: Mastermind - __Status:__ Unimplemented
This game was not familiar to me, so I'm representing it as obscure lol.
